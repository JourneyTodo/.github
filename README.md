# Reach your goals with Journey

Journey is a goal-based todo app that helps you break down your dreams in to incremental, step by step tasks.

## Key concepts

### Goals

A goal is "the end toward which effort is directed," according to Merriam-Webster. In Journey, a goal is the desired outcome you want to achieve. It can be anything, from "I want to eat better" to "I want to land a job at Google." Goals are the highest level of abstraction in Journey.

A goal can consist of subgoals, which are just goals within goals (goalception??). For example, if your goal is to "reach financial independence", your goals and subgoals might look something like this:

**Goal: Reach financial independence**
* Subgoal: Build an emergency fund of 6 months of expenses
* Subgoal: Pay off student loans
* Subgoal: Save for retirement

These goals and subgoals, of course, can be broken down further into sets of tasks. More on that later!

A goal must have a target date. By default, goal will inherit the latest target date of its tasks, but you can also manually set a target date if you'd like. Goals will automatically be marked as complete once all of its tasks are completed.

### Tasks

A task is a concrete, actionable step to be taken to work towards a goal. Tasks are the lowest level of abstraction in Journey. Tasks can be assigned to a goal, and can be marked as complete once they are done.

Most todo apps allow for tasks to be broken down into subtasks, but in Journey, this not needed thanks to goals. Instead of breaking down a task into subtasks, you can create a new goal and assign the task to that goal. If you create a task but find that it's too big to be a task, you can easily convert it into a goal and break it down into smaller tasks.
